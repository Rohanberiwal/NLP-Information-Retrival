System Architecture
====================
1. Frontend Layer
-----------------
   - Technology Stack: React (Web), Flutter (Mobile)
   - Features:
     - User authentication and role-based access control
     - Real-time display of patient data and treatment progress
     - Doctor-patient communication interface

2. Backend Layer
----------------
   - Technology Stack: Node.js (Express framework) / Python (Django)
   - Features:
     - RESTful API or GraphQL for communication
     - User authentication and authorization (OAuth2/JWT)
     - Secure patient data management
     - Communication between healthcare providers and patients

3. Database Layer
-----------------
   - Relational Databases: PostgreSQL (structured data)
   - NoSQL Databases: MongoDB (unstructured data like lab reports)
   - Document Storage: AWS S3 (for images and medical reports)

4. Middleware Layer
-------------------
   - Message Broker: RabbitMQ or Kafka
   - Real-time notifications for lab reports, prescription updates
   - Queues for task scheduling and communication between services

Data Flow
=========
1. Patient Data Flow:
   - Patients input data via frontend (e.g., appointment scheduling)
   - Data is processed and sent to backend API, stored in database
   - Healthcare providers can update and review patient records

2. Lab Data Flow:
   - Lab results are uploaded by lab technicians
   - Reports linked to patient records, accessible by patients and doctors

Security and Compliance
=======================
1. HIPAA Compliance:
   - Patient data stored securely and handled in line with legal requirements
   - Encryption protocols (SSL/TLS) for data transmission and storage

2. Encryption:
   - Data encrypted both in transit and at rest
   - Sensitive medical records protected from unauthorized access

3. Role-Based Access Control:
   - Patients have limited access (their own records)
   - Healthcare providers have full access to their patients' records
